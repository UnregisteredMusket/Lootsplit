# Lootsplit 1.3.1

- Retains all campaign, finance, PDF, reference, multiplayer and appearance features.
- Adds an explicit invitation choice when already connected, with a backup before switching rooms.
- Android exports offer Save file (a persistent location chosen by you) alongside Share.
- Clarifies device-backup recovery and browser-only background push.
- Records explicit transaction types and structured price history for new events, retaining older saves.
- Includes the Greyhaven default party on first initialization; existing campaigns are unchanged.
- Adds release test gates, permanent-certificate verification and APK checksums.

## Install
Download Lootsplit-1.3.1.apk. It updates the permanently signed 1.3.0 app in place. Export a backup before updating. Old debug-signed copies require a one-time backup, uninstall, reinstall and restore; never uninstall before verifying the exported backup.

## Preservation and verification
Local device copies are not external backups. Use Save file and keep the file outside app storage. Importing a backup into the backup list lets you check it without replacing your campaign. Real-device file-picker, force-close recovery and background-delivery behavior still require device validation; automated tests do not substitute for that.
